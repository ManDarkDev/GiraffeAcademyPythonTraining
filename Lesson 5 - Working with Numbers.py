'''I hate arithmetic. It's never been my thing. I was always someone who learned from a historical perspective. What happened? How did pythagorus find his theorem? 
Isaac Newtons Gravitational Equations are cool, from a philosophical perspective, but I don't care for the equations. The equations just verify the philosophy. 
The eqauations confirm the thoughts, but it never preceeds the imagination. Stay away from stupid people. Keep your imagination sharp. Dare to dream. '''

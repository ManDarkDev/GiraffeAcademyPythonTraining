#You can say what you want about Michael Jordan. You can Say what you'd like about Kobe. Kareem Abdul-Jabar is also a vaild choice.
#But Lebron is the most computationally efficient on the basketball court. He's also the most physically gifted.
#Michael Jordan may have been Beehtoven. But Lebron was - and still is - the young and naturally talented Mozart. 
#Kobe. Ah, yes, but of course. The son of a pro. The Black Mamba. The "Prince of all Saiyans." I'd dare to say he was just as skilled as Michael.
#Statistically speaking, Kobe's overall body of work (Less Titles, Less MVPs, Less Scoring titles, and most missed shots ever), would suggest that he's 
#A close second to Jordan. And so that leaves us to the now age-old debate: 
#Is Lebron Better than Michael Jordan?

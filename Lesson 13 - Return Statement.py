def cube(num):# Define a function named 'cube' that takes one argument 'num'
    return num*num*num # Return the cube of 'num' (num raised to the power of 3)

print(result) #print is alwayus written in lowercase. all letters in python are pretty much lowercase... 
# The function returns 125 (5^3) and it is printed to the terminal
